Metrocar Customer Funnel Analysis Project

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber and Lyft, to identify areas for improvement and optimization. By examining the customer journey from initial engagement to ride completion, we aim to uncover insights that can enhance user experience, increase conversion rates, and drive overall growth for the platform.
