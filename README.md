Metrocar Customer Funnel Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber and Lyft, to identify areas for improvement and optimization. By examining the customer journey from initial engagement to ride completion, we hope to uncover insights that can help enhance user experience, increase conversion rates, and drive overall growth for the platform.

Objectives

Identify Bottlenecks: Locate stages where users drop off or face difficulties.
Optimize Conversion Rates: Propose strategies to improve the conversion rates at various stages of the funnel.
Enhance User Experience: Suggest improvements to the app's design and functionality based on user behavior analysis.
